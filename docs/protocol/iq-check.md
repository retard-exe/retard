## 1. THE_INTERROGATION

The system challenges you with high-level cognitive problems (that a 5-year-old could solve).

| Question | Correct Answer | Punishment (Roast) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `1 + 1 = ?` | `2` | "Are you serious? Toddlers know this." |
| `Color of the sky?` | `blue` | "Go see an eye doctor." |
| `Is water wet?` | `yes` | "Physics isn't your strong suit, huh?" |
| `Type 'password' backwards` | `drowssap` | "Can't even spell? Pathetic." |
| `5 * 5 = ?` | `25` | "Use a calculator if you're this slow." |

## 2. EXECUTION_MODES

### A. WEB TERMINAL (Manual)
You can trigger the test manually if you feel confident.

**Command:**
```bash
/testiq
```

* **PASS:** The system will accuse you of cheating (`SCORE: 100%. CHEATER.`).
* **FAIL:** You receive **+70 Stress** and the Avatar laughs at you.

### B. CLI MODE (Mandatory)
In the Command Line Interface, the IQ Check runs **immediately on startup**.

* **FAIL:** The program executes `process.exit(0)` and shuts down.
* **Reason:** The system refuses to talk to anyone who can't do basic math.
