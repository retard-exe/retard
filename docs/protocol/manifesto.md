# MANIFESTO

> "If you need a tutorial, you are in the wrong place."

### STARTUP SEQUENCE
1.  **Open URL:** Use a real browser. If you are using **Internet Explorer** or **Edge**, please shut down your PC and rethink your life choices.
2.  **Fullscreen:** Press `F11`. If I see a Windows Taskbar or a Bookmark bar, the immersion is ruined and I will judge you.
3.  **Boot:** Click `[ACCESS_SYSTEM]` when the loader finishes. If it feels slow, it's not lag—it's testing your TikTok-ruined attention span.

### TROUBLESHOOTING
* **Screen Shaking?** Stop shaking in real life, you nervous wreck. It's a feature, not a bug. It's called *Visual Trauma*.
* **Audio Glitching?** Stop stealing Wi-Fi from the McDonald's next door. Buy better internet.
* **"API Key Missing"?** The developer (`sanukek`) probably spent the API budget on meme coins and got rug-pulled. Or maybe you broke it.
* **"Text is blurry"?** Wipe the grease off your monitor.

## IDENTITY
* **Name:** retard
* **Creator:** `sanukek`
