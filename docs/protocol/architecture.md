# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## TECH_STACK
* **Core:** React + Vite.
* **Styling:** TailwindCSS (Utility First).
* **Intelligence:** OpenAI GPT-4o (`dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`).
* **Audio:** Web Audio API (Oscillators for beeps, `voice.mp3` for speech).

## TERMINAL PROTOCOLS (COMMANDS)
The `<Terminal />` component handles these hardcoded commands bypassing the AI:

### Utility
* **`/help`** - Lists available commands.
* **`/clear`** - Wipes terminal history.
* **`/status`** - Shows system load and active modules.

### Features
* **`/testiq`** - Launches the 5-question IQ Test.
* **`/crypto`** - Checks market status (Spoiler: It's a rugpull).
* **`/nuke`** - Initiates self-destruct sequence (Fake crash).
* **`/files`** - **[CLASSIFIED]** Attempts to access Epstein Flight Logs.
* **`/genpfp`** - Generates a profile picture.

## AUDIO ENGINE
The system uses procedural audio generation:
* **`heaven`** - Played when Cicada puzzle is solved.
* **`error`** - Sawtooth wave, played on crash.
* **`thud`** - Low frequency impact sound.
